INTRODUCTION                                                           *take-a-break.nvim*
    
This is a fun plugin that I created which outputs a message every 30
minutes to tell the user to take a little break. This plugins helps the user
to get up from there seat and walk around the area that they are in for a 
couple of minutes to refresh their mind.

                                                        *take-a-break.setup()*
The setup function takes nothing as input. Just call the 
function and the plugin should start outputting a message 
every 30 minutes telling you to take a break.

                                                  *take-a-break.showMessage()*
This function starts up the plugin which sends the message every
30 minutes.
